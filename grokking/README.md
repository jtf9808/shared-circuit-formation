# Grokking
Experiments based on [Progress measures for grokking via mechanistic interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05217)

# Plan

1. Extend grokking experiments to do multiple operations (start with + and - then move to more disparate operations)
2. Check it groks (does it grok together?)
3. Reverse engineer the circuits to compare to the above paper
4. Investigate variations - training in stages, can grokking be hidden by training on many different operations.
